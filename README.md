Crane Remote is a project of a model crane that is operated with a joystick via Arduino. It also has an automatic Anti-Sway control implemented. An Anti-Sway control is a system which  is actively involved in the crane's movomenet to minimize hook oscillations. These oscillations are generated at accelerating and decelerating the hook. For the Anti-Sway control, the hook position is measured using a webcam and template matching with OpenCV in a python script.
